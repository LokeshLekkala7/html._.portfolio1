<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>"Hi there, I'm Lokesh"<br /> I Recently completed my schooling in Sri Chaitanya.I'm a Boy from a Middle Class Family.
  I love tinkering with gadgets and figuring out how things work. Whether it's building model rockets or programming simple
  apps, I'm always up for a challenge. When I'm not lost in the world of science and technology, you can find me in the streets,
  and watching Crickrt by cheering up my favourite Team,  chilling with friends, watching superhero movies, or reading adventure
  novels. I guess you could say I'm a bit of a tech geek with a passion for action and adventure!"

  Oh, and don't be surprised if you catch me jamming out to some classic rock or hip-hop in my free time. Life's all about
   finding the perfect balance between adrenaline and creativity, you know?"
